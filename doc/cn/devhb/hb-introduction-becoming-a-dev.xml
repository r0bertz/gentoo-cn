<title>Introduction</title>
<body>

<p>
There are many ways to become a Gentoo developer, which this section
discusses. There are also various steps that new "recruits" have to
go through before they become official developers.
</p>

</body>

<section>
<title>Helping out</title>
<body>

<p>
Firstly; to be asked to become a developer you should either apply
to an opening, or just help out whether in the form of user support
or filing bug reports - we notice frequent contributors making
contributions to Gentoo and we attempt to reward them by giving
them the chance to become a Gentoo developer. Gentoo has many
paths, and the Gentoo Developer Relations Recruitment
Team is always looking out not just for developers - documentation
writers and infrastructure maintainers are just as important too for
our distribution to run smoothly.
</p>

<p>
You should look out for openings for developers in the GWN, as well as
the /topic of #gentoo-bugs on irc.freenode.net - if you feel you could fill
in one of those positions, try to find a mentor who is willing to sponsor you,
or contact the <mail link="recruiters@gentoo.org">Gentoo Recruiters</mail> who
may be able to find a mentor for you. Please do not file "New Developer" bugs
on yourself since this task is designated for the mentor and any such bugs will be
closed.
</p>

</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Mentoring</title>
<body>

<p>
All new developers must have a mentor, who is an existing Gentoo
developer responsible for guiding a new developer as well as 
offering to help the developer later after the developer
has passed through the recruitment process.
</p>

<p>
A mentor should assist you by helping you with any
questions you might have, as well as outlining your Gentoo
responsibilities, especially those in relation to what you
would initially work on.
</p>

<p>
Once a developer agrees to mentor a new developer, the mentor should file a
bug and assign it to the Gentoo Recruiters - the
<uri link="/proj/en/devrel/recruiters">Gentoo Recruiters</uri>
page explains in detail what information should be filed.
</p>

<note>
The Gentoo Recruiters reserve the right to assign a developer a new mentor if
the initial mentor is idle to queries about the new developer or if the mentor
files the bug but then does not assist the new developer through the rest of
the process.
</note>

<section>
<title>Waiting</title>
<body>

<p>
All new developers pass through a waiting period of one or two
weeks, depending on how ready the mentor thinks the developer is as well as
feedback from any other related staff. During this time, the new
developer should complete the quiz which would be reviewed by the developer's
mentor and the Gentoo Recruiters to ensure that the developer is "ready".
In special cases, the waiting period is determined by
the Recruiters and/or Gentoo Developer Relations leads.
</p>

<p>
Two quizzes are offered: the
<uri link="/proj/en/devrel/quiz/ebuild-quiz.txt">ebuild
quiz</uri>, and the 
<uri link="/proj/en/devrel/quiz/staff-quiz.txt">staff
quiz</uri>. Developers who will be working purely on
infrastructure, GLSAs or other non-ebuild areas should
take the staff quiz, any developers who require commit
access to the Portage tree should take the ebuild quiz.
</p>

<p>
Once a new developer has completed the quiz, the developer should send it off to
the mentor who is responsible for reviewing it in conjunction with
the <uri link="/proj/en/devrel/recruiters">Gentoo Recruiters</uri>.
If the quiz answers are deemed to be to of a sufficient standard, then
the recruitment process would continue. Otherwise, a new developer can
redo the quiz again, providing that it is completed in the waiting
period.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, new developers should be responsive to any members of
the Recruiters Team who have any questions - any developers who do
not reply promptly will have their "New Developer" bug closed, which
would only be reopened at the discretion of the Gentoo Recruiters.
</p>

</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Jumping the gap</title>
<body>

<p>
After your mentor and the Gentoo Recruiters have reviewed your quiz and
deemed it to be of a suitable standard, you should send it along with
an SSH2 DSA passworded key to the Gentoo Recruiters. If the Recruiters
consider your quiz to be of a satisfactory standard, they will set you up
with the services that you require.
</p>

<p>
After this time, you enter a "probationary period" of 30 days during which
your mentor is responsible for your actions, providing accountability
- also, Gentoo Recruiters may reject new developers during this time if
they feel it is appropriate.
